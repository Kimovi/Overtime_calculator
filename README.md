# Overtime Calculator
This web app is created for my husband who sadly have to work lots of overtimes. 
He struggles to manage the over worked hours and rates. 

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Netlify

HTML and CSS was used to render the index.html page. 
This application was built in Vanila Javascript. I have managed to implement CRUD funtionality using DOM manipulation. 

# How to use
Simply add your anual salary then click 'submit' button. Then add date and hours. 
Your overtime pays are calculated before tax
